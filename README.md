### Greetings!
My name is Eda                                                                        
I'm a tech enthusiast.       
Learning more and more everyday about cybersecurity, web development and programming.                                                                       
In my free time I like to read and solve Math problems (super nerdy I know). I'm also interested in photography!                                                            
       

If you'd like to say hello, find me here:
