I'm a student but most importantly a tech enthusiast.       
Learning more and more everyday about cybersecurity, web development and programming.                 
In my free time I like to read and solve Math problems. (super nerdy I know)                                         
Currently completing picoCTF challenges, overthewire.org wargames, cryptohack courses and having lots of fun building basic but fun projects. Check them out! :D                                                    
Residing in the UK
